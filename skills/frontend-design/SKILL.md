# Frontend Design Skill

## Overview

This skill enables the creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces. It provides guidance on building polished, accessible, and performant user interfaces using modern frontend technologies and best practices.

## Core Capabilities

### Component Architecture
- Building reusable, composable UI components
- Implementing component libraries and design systems
- Creating prop interfaces with TypeScript
- Managing component state and lifecycle

### Modern Framework Expertise
- React (functional components, hooks, context)
- Vue (composition API, reactivity)
- Modern CSS techniques (CSS-in-JS, CSS modules, Tailwind)
- Server-side rendering and static site generation

### Design & UX
- Implementing pixel-perfect designs from mockups
- Creating smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliance, ARIA, keyboard navigation)

### Performance Optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Memoization and optimization techniques
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Bundle size minimization

### Best Practices
- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS architecture and organization
- Component testing strategies
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Modern linting and formatting (ESLint, Prettier)

## Usage Guidelines

### Starting a New Frontend Project
- Set up project structure with modern tooling
- Configure build systems (Vite, Webpack, Parcel)
- Integrate TypeScript
- Set up linting and formatting

### Building UI Components
- Create component specifications before implementation
- Follow atomic design principles
- Ensure component reusability
- Test component behavior

### Styling Approaches
- CSS-in-JS solutions (styled-components, emotion, goober)
- CSS Modules for scoped styling
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- PostCSS for custom CSS processing

### State Management
- React Context for simple global state
- Redux Toolkit for complex state
- Zustand for lightweight alternatives
- Server state with React Query or SWR

## Technology Stack Recommendations

### Recommended Tools
- **Build Tool**: Vite (fast, modern)
- **Framework**: React 18+ or Vue 3
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules
- **State**: Zustand or React Query
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library

### Accessibility Standards
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Color contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1
- ARIA labels where appropriate
- Focus indicators on all focusable elements

## Design Principles

1. **Consistency**: Use design tokens for colors, spacing, typography
2. **Clarity**: Clear visual hierarchy and content organization
3. **Feedback**: Interactive elements provide clear feedback states
4. **Performance**: Fast load times, smooth animations at 60fps
5. **Accessibility**: Inclusive design for all users
