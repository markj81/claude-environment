# Figma Integration Skill

This skill provides comprehensive Figma integration for design-to-code workflows.

## Capabilities

### Reading Designs
- Get design context from any Figma node to generate UI code
- Read detailed information about selected frames, components, or elements
- Scan text nodes and child node types within designs
- Extract design metadata and structure

### Code Generation
- Generate production-ready UI code from Figma designs
- Create design system rules for consistent styling
- Get component mappings and Code Connect suggestions
- Export nodes as images for reference

### Design Exploration
- Get detailed node information (positions, styles, properties)
- Explore local components and design tokens
- View annotations and design specifications
- Understand prototyping reactions and connections

### Working with Selection
- Get current Figma selection details
- Focus on specific nodes or frames
- Set selections to multiple nodes
- View authenticated user info

## Usage Examples

- "Read this Figma frame and generate React code"
- "What components are defined in this design?"
- "Generate a design system from this Figma file"
- "Export this button component as an image"
- "Get the design context for node 123:456"

## Prerequisites

Ensure the Figma MCP server is configured in your Claude Code settings for full functionality.
