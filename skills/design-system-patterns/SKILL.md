# Design System Patterns Skill

This skill enables building scalable design systems with design tokens for consistent UI development.

## Capabilities

### Design Token Management
- Create and organize design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, shadows, borders, sizing)
- Define token hierarchies (primitive tokens, semantic tokens, component tokens)
- Generate token documentation and JSON/CSS/SCSS exports
- Maintain token consistency across platforms

### Component Pattern Generation
- Generate reusable component patterns with consistent styling
- Create component variants based on design tokens
- Establish component composition patterns
- Define component API contracts

### Design System Architecture
- Structure design systems for scalability
- Define naming conventions for tokens and components
- Create component documentation templates
- Establish versioning strategies

### Token Transformation
- Convert design tokens across formats (CSS variables, SCSS maps, JSON, Tailwind config)
- Generate platform-specific token implementations
- Create token alias chains
- Manage light/dark theme tokens

## Usage Examples

- "Create design tokens for a color palette with primary, secondary, and neutral colors"
- "Generate typography tokens from font specifications"
- "Build a button component using design tokens"
- "Export design tokens as CSS custom properties"
- "Set up a design token structure for a new design system"
- "Convert these design tokens to Tailwind config format"

## Prerequisites

This skill works with any design system implementation. Design tokens can be sourced from Figma, Style Dictionary, or created manually.
